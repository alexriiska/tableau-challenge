## Phenomenon 1:

All 10 of the Top 10 Starting Stations by the number of rides are also in the Top 10 Ending Stations by the number of rides. The top three stations are the same in both cases: (1) West St & Chambers St, (2) W 21 St & 6 Ave, and (3) University Pl & E 14 St. This finding isnâ€™t very surprising considering that these three stations are in heavily trafficked areas of Manhattan. Similarly, the other seven of the top 10 locations are also in heavily trafficked areas of New York City.

## Phenomenon 2:

Many of the starting locations in the Top 50 Starting Stations by Average Duration (minutes) are in the Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most wealthy boroughs of the five boroughs so it is likely that wealthy individuals use the Citi bikes at these stations for their daily exercise.

On the other hand, the distribution for the Top 50 Ending Stations by Average Duration (minutes) is more dispersed. The ending location with the highest average duration is 12 Ave & W 125 St, located in Upper Manhattan, with an average ride duration of 62 minutes. Many of the stations in the top 50 by average duration are located in the heart of Manhattan and have average ride durations of about 20 minutes. It is likely that these stations are used less for the purpose of exercise but instead for the purpose of running quick errands, like picking up dinner from a restaurant.
